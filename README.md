# Todos Full Stack Website Mini Project

I did this web application to start learning full stack development.

It is a simple Todos website where you can : 
  - ADD tasks
  - EDIT them
  - CHECK them when they are done
  - DELETE them

The goal of this project was to :
  - Build a web application
  - Build a working database for this application
  - And then deploy it

The application is available here : https://full-stack-initiation.vercel.app/
